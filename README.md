# Automation Test For Trado
TRADO developed marketplace platform is unique in its entirety and the scope of the solution it provides to users â€“ retailers/buyers and suppliers/sellers. Unlike existing trading platforms in the B2B market that produce a relationship between suppliers and buyers, the platform is developed to produce an anonymous market.


The system provides management tools, decision-making, tracking, and alerts when it relies on user behavior data, contact with users' purchasing and inventory systems, contact with moving systems, and contact external systems for information to assess the capabilities of the buyer seeking financial assistance and more. The development is innovative and challenging.


The project is about preparing an automation test framework for Trado website. The framework consists of several tests that examine different features of the websites. This project also includ manual testing to test some featurs of the website.In the project there are 3 servers have been used. One is the website's server in which all website data is recorded, the second one is AWS cloud server that had been used to store test data, and the last one is local SQL server to to record test reports that gives detail information about a bug.
